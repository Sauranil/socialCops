It's about time that the supporting libraries grow up too.\n\nLooking for a complete, end-to-end, battle tested, performance optimized CSV parser that's available in the familiar jQuery syntax style? Welcome...\n\nThis library is a different creature, featuring a slim Chomsky - Type III parser implementation. Full (that means 100%) [IETF RFC 4180](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) compliance. Including coverage for a few edge cases that even the spec fails to cover.\n\nEnough with the wind-up...\n\nWant to see it in action? Check out the [Basic Usage Demo](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/basic-usage.html).\n\nWant more? The Use Cases section below has what you need.\n\nAside: To the script kiddies... Don't be sad, we bet there are still plenty of people who would like to hear you outline the merits of `str.split()`.\n\n# Features\n\n* Convert a CSV String to an array\n* Convert a multi-line CSV string to a 2D array\n* Convert a multi-line CSV string to an array of objects (ie header:value pairs)\n* Convert an array of values to CSV (under development)\n* Convert an array of objects to CSV (under development)\n* Hooks/Callbacks to extend the default parsing process\n* Customizable delimiter (default: \") and separator (default: ,) characters\n* Node.js support (ie CommonJS importing and async callback support)\n\n# Syntax\n\n## Importing\n\n**Client-Side** (ie browser) - import via the script element.\n```javascript\n<script src=\"jquery-csv.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**Server-Side** (ie Node.js) - Import via the standard CommonJS approach.\n```javascript\nvar $ = jQuery = require('jquery');\nrequire('./jquery.csv.js');\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nEach one of the methods can be called with the following form:\n```javascript\n$.csv.function(csv, {options}, callback);\n```\n\n| Name\t\t  |           | Description |\n|-----------|-----------|:------------|\n| csv\t\t    | required\t| The csv data to be transformed. |\n| options\t  | optional\t| An object containing user-defined overrides for the default options. |\n| callback\t| optional\t| Used for Node.js-style async callbacks. Uses the form function(err, data). |\n\n## Methods\n\n**toArray**\n\nParse a single entry string to an array\n```javascript\n$.csv.toArray(csv);\n```\n*Documented under API#$.csv.toArray().*\n\n**toArrays**\n\nParse a multi-line CSV string to a 2D array\n```javascript\n$.csv.toArrays(csv);\n```\n*Documented under API#$.csv.toArrays().*\n\n**toObjects**\n\nParse a multi-line CSV string to an array of objects\n```javascript\n$.csv.toObjects(csv);\n```\n*Documented under API#$.csv.toObjects().*\n\n**fromArrays**\n\nConvert array data to a CSV string\n```javascript\n$.csv.fromArrays(arrays);\n```\n\n**fromObjects**\n\nConvert an array of objects to a CSV string\n```javascript\n$.csv.fromObjects(objects);\n```\n\n# Documentation\n\n- [API](./docs/api.md)\n- [Hooks & Callbacks](./docs/hooks-callbacks.md)\n- [Algorithm](./docs/algorithm.md)\n\n# Use Cases\n\nWhat fun is having a shiny new library without examples to play with?\n\nNo fun that's what... That is coming from a guy who has spent entirely too much time mucking through API documentation when he'd much rather be out at the beach, surfing, or chasing girls.\n\nInstead of the typical useless contrived example code, I have provided a handful of simple yet powerful demos. Not only are they fun to play with but a quick peak at the source will show you how simple and easy they were to implement.\n\nWho knows... maybe this whole 'having fun' concept may spread to some of the other Open Source libraries as a result. One can dream...\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nWant to play with the parser and maybe validate your CSV data without all the frills? No need to download the source first, there's a demo for that...\n\n[jQuery-CSV - Basic Usage Demonstration](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/basic-usage.html)\n\n## Client-Side File Handling\n\nYes, you read that right. It's now possible to open local files in the browser without firing a single request to the server.\n\nThe functionality is still pretty new so not all browsers support it (I'm looking @ you IE). If that's not an issue I highly suggest you try it. It's much easier than the traditional client/server approach.\n\n[jQuery-CSV - File Handling Demonstration](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/file-handling.html)\n\n## jQuery-CSV + Flot\n\nHands down, the most exciting addition to the demo collection so far...\n\nYou can input the data set using either the text area provided or via uploading CSV data files.\n\nWant to plot 5 data sets on the same grid, no problem; Just upload 5 files containing one dataset each. The jQuery-CSV will handle the plumbing while Flot will make it all look pretty.\n\n[jQuery-CSV - Flot Demonstration](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/flot.html)\n\n## jQuery-CSV + Google Visualization API\n\nOK, I lied. This one is even cooler than Flot. Hike up your fancy pants because these things look slick.\n\nDon't want to draw a line graph, no problem you can tap into the massive collection of different graph types available. Embedded is a fully configurable dashboard.\n\nWarning: You may experience multiple spontaneous 'oh my got that's soo awesome' fits of excitement. Maybe even get stoked. Happens to the best us...\n\n[jQuery-CSV - Google Visualization API Demonstration](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/google-visualization.html)\n\n## jQuery-CSV + Node.js\n\nWhat's better than a powerful JavaScript? platform in the browser. A second, even more powerful JavaScript? platform on the server.\n\nAnd... jQuery-CSV fully supports it. There is not online demo because it requires a Node.js server to run but a stub is provided to help get you started.\n\nDependencies:\n\nTo make this example work, you'll also need to install jQuery via the NPM.\n\n```npm install jquery```\n\nThe link to the stub:\n\n[node-usage.js](http://evanplaice.github.io/jquery-csv/examples/node-usage.js)\n\n**jQuery-CSV** coding style is inherited from the [JQuery Core Style Guidelines](https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/)\n\nby **Evan Plaice**\n\n",
